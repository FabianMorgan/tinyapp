# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Hi, I am Fabian Morgan, a student web developer at Lighthouse Labs. Although a difficult challenge, I enjoyed the learning experience of building my first app, and one that required work on the frontend and backend. A big shoutout to the mentors who has helped me along this journey. And thanks to Lighthouse Labs for the learning experience.
